# Backend System for a Car Website

In this project, I use Spring Boot, APIs, Swagger-based API documentation and testing to implement a RESTful API for the Vehicles API that serves as an endpoint to track vehicle inventory, as well as converting a Pricing Service API to a microservice.. While the primary Vehicles API will perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) related to vehicle details like make, model, color, etc., it will need to consume data from other APIs as well regarding location and pricing data. 


## Instructions

Check each component to see its details and instructions. Note that all three applications
should be running at once for full operation.

- [Vehicles API](vehicles-api/README.md)
- [Pricing Service](pricing-service/README.md)
- [Boogle Maps](boogle-maps/README.md)

## Dependencies

The project requires the use of Maven and Spring Boot, along with Java v11.
